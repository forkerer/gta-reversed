## gtasa-reversed [![Build Status](https://github.com/saml1er/gta-reversed/workflows/Build/badge.svg?event=push&branch=master)](https://github.com/saml1er/gta-reversed/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

A project to reverse Grand Theft Auto San Andreas completely, and to rewrite and document every function. 

### Discord
[Join our discord server](https://discord.gg/P5zVn6C). You can request us to decompile a function for you. If you wish to contribute, then we'll be happy to assist you.

### What exactly is this project? 
Building this project will result in a DLL file, that DLL file can be injected into GTA:SA using any ASI loader out there. After the DLL file has been injected, the ingame functions will be replaced by the reversed code. The game will behave exactly the same. Now if we make any changes to the reversed code, it will take effect in the game. The goal is to keep reversing until we have the entire game reversed to compile a standalone executable.

### Progress
The progress of reversed functions can be tracked [here](docs/ReversedClasses.MD).

### Build Instructions
You can either build with Premake5 or CMake, that's up to you.
##### Premake5
1) Clone the project, including the submodules `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/saml1er/gta-reversed.git`.
